        <b>Tic Tac Toe</b>, often referred to as Noughts and Crosses, is a classic game enjoyed by people of all ages around the world. Despite its simple rules and straightforward gameplay, Tic Tac Toe offers an engaging challenge that requires strategic thinking and foresight.

        The game is typically played on a 3x3 grid, although variations with larger grids exist. Players take turns marking empty squares with their chosen symbol, usually an "X" or an "O", with the objective of forming a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their symbols.

        What makes Tic Tac Toe intriguing is the balance between offense and defense. Players must simultaneously strive to create their own winning lines while blocking their opponent from achieving theirs. This delicate balance adds depth to what might initially seem like a straightforward game.

        However, due to its simple rules and limited board size, Tic Tac Toe is a game that can be fully analyzed. Skilled players can easily determine the optimal moves for any given board state, leading to a high likelihood of the game ending in a draw when both players play optimally.

        Despite this predictability, Tic Tac Toe remains a popular pastime for several reasons. Its simplicity makes it accessible to players of all ages and skill levels, making it an excellent choice for passing the time or introducing newcomers to the world of strategy games. Additionally, Tic Tac Toe serves as a foundation for more complex games, providing players with a basic understanding of concepts such as board control, pattern recognition, and strategic planning.

        Overall, Tic Tac Toe is a timeless classic that continues to captivate players with its blend of simplicity and strategic depth. Whether played casually for fun or approached with a competitive mindset, Tic Tac Toe offers an enjoyable experience that never fails to entertain.

    <h1>How to Play </h1></center>
    <p>
        Certainly! Here's a step-by-step guide on how to play Tic Tac Toe:

        <b>Setup:</b> Begin with an empty 3x3 grid. This grid consists of nine squares arranged in three rows and three columns.<br>
       <b> Choose Symbols:</b> Decide which player will use "X" and which will use "O". Traditionally, one player uses X and the other uses O.<br>
        <b>Take Turns: </b>Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) in an empty square on the grid. The player using X usually goes first.<br>
        <b>Objective:</b> The goal is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of your symbols.<br>
        <b>Winning Conditions:</b> The game ends when one player achieves a line of three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. The player who accomplishes this wins the game.<br>
        <b>Draw Condition:</b> If all squares on the grid are filled and neither player has achieved a winning line, the game is a draw.<br>
        <b>Strategy:</b> Players must balance offensive and defensive moves. They aim to create their own winning lines while blocking their opponent from doing the same.<br>
        <b>Replay:</b> After a game ends (either in a win, draw, or by mutual agreement to end), players can choose to play again, alternating who goes first.<br>
